# Vision Transformer-Enhanced Multi-Descriptor Ap-proach for Robust Age-Invariant Face Recognition

This repository contains Python scripts for processing images from the MORPH II &FGNET datasets, converting them to grayscale, detecting faces, resizing them, and extracting features using ViT (Vision Transformer), SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), and LBP (Local Binary Patterns). The extracted features are then fused and dimensions reduced for classification with machine learning models such as Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors.
